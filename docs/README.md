## Introduction

The Kitchen Foods platform addresses a significant gap in the Sri Lankan market by connecting verified home chefs. This includes particularly women looking for income generating opportunities with customers like office workers, tourists and local residents. Many skilled individuals in local communities lack the means to access traditional commercial markets, while consumers often struggle to find healthy and authentic homemade meals. By establishing a hyper-local digital marketplace, the system allows these chefs to monetize their skills directly from their own kitchens. This solution promotes economic empowerment and financial independence while simultaneously improving public health and cultural food accessibility. Ultimately, the platform serves as a secure technology bridge that combines community-based food preparation with modern convenience to ensure trust and efficiency for both parties
